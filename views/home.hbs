    <p>Furnitech Furniture Solutions</p>
    <p>
      Founded in 2021 by Joshua Griep and Sean Bleyl following the downfall
      of WeWork, we are a rapidly growing furniture retailer, and we want
      <strong>YOUR</strong> business!
    </p>
    <p>
      We already provide cheap, tacky, and slightly off-color home and office
      furnishings in Chicago, LA, San Francisco, and New York City.
    </p>
    <p>But with your help, we could do so much more.</p>
    <p>We're talking Baton Rouge. We're talking Quarters Lane. Call us crazy, but we even have dreams of making it big in Omaha...</p>
    <p>And with your continued support, we just might get there.</p>
